# graph-visualizer-PySide6
Get Falimiliar with PySide6 library for building simple UIs with Python. In this very simple app, I implemented the BFS and DFS algorithms for traversing a matrix that might have some obstacles. In the UI, the user can choose which algorithm to run and 
see the step-by-step execution of the algo in a viasual manner.


# Instructions
1. pip install -r requirements.py
2. python ui.py

Note: A dedicated virtual env is strongly recommended.
